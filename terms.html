                    <p>Welcome to the Age of Makers game (the “Game”), an interactive curriculum supporting curated STEAM programs for Educators (described below). We’re glad you’re here, and we hope you enjoy everything we have to offer. Please read these Age of Makers Terms of Service (“Terms”) carefully because they are a binding agreement between You and Salesforce.com, inc., (“Salesforce” or “We”). Please also review the <a href="privacy.html">Age of Makers Game Privacy Policy</a> (“Privacy Policy”), which is incorporated herein, and available <a href="privacy.html">here</a>.</p>

                    <h4>The Game</h4>

                    <p>The Game works as a Google Chrome extension that enables a personalized learning experience primarily for teen students 13 years old and above. The Game has been designed to be used in conjunction with teachers and volunteers authorized by the educational institution (“Educators”) who can guide the students in their learnings outside of the Game. The Game should only be used by students for whom Educators have obtained all necessary consents from the students’ parents or guardians to their participation as required under applicable local law and per any applicable third-party terms.</p>

                    <p>To begin the Game, students, parents or legal guardians, and Educators (“Users”) should download the Chrome extension, log in locally on their computers, and navigate the application as desired or directed. Users may also interact with the curriculum through the handbook available in the game related to the program they chose.</p>

                    <p>Please also ensure that You review the Google Chrome <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/terms/" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/privacy/" target="_blank">Privacy Notice</a>.</p>

                    <h4>Notice to Educators</h4>

                    <p><u>Educators:</u> there are a few steps You should take to work with students using the game. First, You should review any guides related to the Game’s curriculums and available on <a href="https://trailhead.salesforce.com/" target="_blank">Trailhead</a>. Second, if a student wants to play the Game, but the student’s parent or legal guardian has not yet given consent, You will ensure that the student’s parent or legal guardian gives consent and approval or that You, in conjunction with the relevant educational institution or school district, obtains consent as required under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). Third, you may use this Game Yourself or to preview what students will play. If You are an Educator who will be using the Game with students in Your district, educational institution, or classroom, student data provided or generated through Your or Your Students’ use of the Game, particularly in relation to Third Party Sites, may be subject to FERPA.</p>
