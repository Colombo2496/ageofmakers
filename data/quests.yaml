  order: 0
  content: |-
    Let's start with the foundation:

    1. Drag out a cube from the basic shapes tab.
    2. Then size it according to how big you want your house to be! If you want to have the exact same size as in the picture, it is (LxWxH) 40x25x20.

    Since this is a basic house, we don't have to add an extra cube to make a bigger floor plan.  

    ```info
    If you wish, you can add another cube and size it to the desired floor plan. Just make sure your height for both cubes is the same. If you connected cubes together to make one big floor plan, follow the next step.
    ```

- name: Grouping the Cubes to One Big Shape
  order: 1
  content: |-
    ```info
    If you just have a simple square, skip this step.
    ```

    Okay, So now for those who added cubes to make a bigger floor plan, follow these steps:

    1. Left-click and drag over ALL the cubes.
    2. Now both(all) cubes will be selected and they will have a light blue line surround the object.
    3. When the cubes are selected look at the toolbar, do you see the little emoticon that looks like a mountain, click it and the "floor plan" will group so now it's one whole object. When you move the object, everything will move! You can also do (Ctrl + G) to group :)

    ![House base 2](https://ageofmakers.s3.amazonaws.com/Tinkercad:%20How%20to%20Make%20a%20Simple%201%20Story%20House%20(For%203D%20Printing):%207%20Steps%20(with%20Pictures)%202019-04-01%2010-21-19.png)
- name: Roofing
  order: 2
  content: |-
    Now that you've grouped the house or just left it at a simple cube house, we need to do the roof!

    1. Grab the roof shape and drag it on the workplane.
    2. Click the roof so you can edit it (make it bigger) But first, we need to put it on top on the house! if you click the roof you will see an arrow-like shape, if you click and drag up the object will float up, if you click and drag down, the object will go down.
    3. Drag the object enough so that the roof fits perfectly on top of the house.
    4. Rotate it so it can align with the house.
    5. Size the roof so it is the same size as the house which would be 40x25.

      
    ![Roof House](https://ageofmakers.s3.amazonaws.com/Tinkercad:%20How%20to%20Make%20a%20Simple%201%20Story%20House%20(For%203D%20Printing):%207%20Steps%20(with%20Pictures)%202019-04-01%2010-25-03.png)
- name: Fixing Roof
  order: 3
  content: |-
    Next, we make the roof have an overhang. I like to add 2 units to all sides. This creates a nice overhang. 
    
    Next, we left click and drag then group. 
    
    ```info
    When you group it, the objects will turn all the same color.  
    ```
      
    ![House roof fix](https://ageofmakers.s3.amazonaws.com/Tinkercad:%20How%20to%20Make%20a%20Simple%201%20Story%20House%20(For%203D%20Printing):%207%20Steps%20(with%20Pictures)%202019-04-01%2010-26-38.png)
- name: Windows
  order: 4
  content: |-
    Now we are going to add windows.

    1. I add a cube(s) and make them flat and shape it like a window.
    2. Say you want to have more windows they exact size. Select the window and press (Ctrl + D) this will duplicate the object, so now you can add as many windows as you want, the same size!
    3. Finally, group all this.

    ![Windows](https://ageofmakers.s3.amazonaws.com/Tinkercad:%20How%20to%20Make%20a%20Simple%201%20Story%20House%20(For%203D%20Printing):%207%20Steps%20(with%20Pictures)%202019-04-01%2010-29-00.png)
- name: Door
  order: 5
  content: |-
    Last but not least, we need to add a door!

    1. Drab a box into the workplane and size it down to a door. Whatever accommodate's your house :)
    2. Drag it in the house and when you are selecting it, look at the info box, it says "hole".
    3. Click hole and the door will turn black.
    4. Then group the house.

    The door will disappear making it look more dimensional!  
      
    ![Door](https://ageofmakers.s3.amazonaws.com/Tinkercad:%20How%20to%20Make%20a%20Simple%201%20Story%20House%20(For%203D%20Printing):%207%20Steps%20(with%20Pictures)%202019-04-01%2010-29-59.png)

  order: 6

    Now you are done with the basics of the house! Time to make it yours, that's the most exciting part :D

    * What about adding another story?
    * What if you wanted to build a whole building?
    * Can you make the inside of the house as a hole?

    Let your creativity flow!

  This project turns the micro:bit into a simple stopwatch. Pressing **B** will start the timer. Pressing **A** will add 1 second to the timer. Let‚Äôs get started.

startUrl: https://makecode.microbit.org
positionLeft: 62
positionTop: 80
stages:
- name: Create a Variable
  content: |-
    The first thing we have to do, is to create a variable, which is like a small memory in your brain. We will use it to store how much time is there left on the timer.  
      
    ![User-added image](https://ageofmakers.s3.amazonaws.com/Stopwatch%20Screens%20-%20Variable.gif)

    1.  Create a **New Project**
    2.  Click the **Variables** menu and click **Make a Variable**. You can enter any name that describe it, we will use _timer_ in this example.
    3.  Bring the "**set timer**" block in the **on start** section to set an initial stopwatch timer value.
    4.  We'll start at 3 seconds, so click on the 0 value and change it to 3
    5.  Now, we always want to see how much time is there left, so drag the "**show** **string**" block from the **Basic** menu to the **forever** section.
    6.  You'll have to show the timer value, so go in the **Variables** menu and drag the **timer** block in place of the original text.
  order: 0
- name: Allow Time Increment
  content: |-
    Now, we need to be able to increment the initial value of our stopwatch timer: every time you press button A, it'll add 1s to the timer.  

    ![User-added image](https://ageofmakers.s3.amazonaws.com/Stopwatch%20Screens%20-%20Increment.gif)

    1.  Drag a on **button A pressed** block from the **Input** menu.
    2.  Open the **Variables** menu and drag a "**change timer by...**" block in the button A pressed section.
    
    ```info
    The &quot;change ... by&quot; allows you to update the value of a variable by a certain amount.
    ```
    
    Try clicking on the button A in the emulator!
  order: 1
- name: Code the Timer
  content: |-
    Last but not least, time to code the countdown!  
      
    ![User-added](https://ageofmakers.s3.amazonaws.com/Stopwatch%20Screens%20-%20Final.gif)

    1.  Bring another "**on button ... pressed**" block
    2.  Change button A to B
    3.  We will use a **Loops** block this time, that allows you to repeat actions. Drag a **while** block.
    4.  We need to define the **Logic** behind the loop, so drag a **< comparison block**
    5.  Then bring the **timer** variable to have: _timer > 0_
    6.  The whole trick happens now: bring a **pause** block from the **Basic** section.
    7.  This block will have the microbit wait for a certain time. Change it to **1 second** (1000 milliseconds)
    8.  Now that it waits for 1 seconds, it needs to update the variable: 
        1.  Drag a **change timer by** block
        2.  Update it from to **\-1**

    Voil√†!! Your stopwatch is coded. Good job!  
      
    Try it on your micro:bit now ;)

        *   Click on **Duplicate**
    *   Click on **A** to change it to **B**
    *   Click on the 180 value in the "_servo write pin..._" block and use the slider to change it to 0 for button A.

    1.  Create a **New Project**
    2.  Click the **Variables** menu and click **Make a Variable**. You can enter any name that describe it, we will use _lightLevel_ in this example.
    3.  Bring the "**set lightLevel**" block in the **forever** section to always keep an accurate value.
    4.  Go to the **Input** category and bring the **light level** block to the "set lightLevel" block.
    5.  Now it's time to show it! 
        1.  In the **LED** section, drag a **plot bar graph**
        2.  Replace the top 0 by a **lightLevel** block
        3.  Change the bottom 0 value with 255, which is the maximum value the light sensor can return.
