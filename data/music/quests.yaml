    Navigate to your song to start expanding your snog. 

    **Option 1: You're using one of our base track?**
    - Make sure you understand the current structure of the song. Where is the chorus? the verse?
    - If you have your lyrics already, see if those fit in the current length. Try to adapt the number of bars (extend or shorten) based on your need.
    - You can also play around with changing what gets added/remove when the song goes from Verse to Chorus and the other way around. Have fun with the intro and outro too!
    
    **Option 2: You've started from scratch**
    - You most probably have a few bars available. 
    - See what you want to use for your chorus, and then start working on your intro. Make sure it fits your vision and what you want to convey through your song.
    - Iterate until you have at least one verse and one chorus. Ideally you have 2 of them though ;)

    Try to spot the tracks that are either too loud or hard to hear, and adjust the volume accordingly.

    ```info
    Note that volumes might need to be different throughout your song. Your pads might need to be higher in the verse (where there no much to compete against), that in your chorus (where there is a lot more sound). 

    ‚û°Ô∏è Remember that you can use automation to control your volumes over time.
    ```

    ```info
    You can also spread certain tracks in stereo. One track will be more on the left where the other will be more on the right, and they won't be on top of each other that much. üôÉ
